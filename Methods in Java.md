# Methods in Java
- Methods are a subtasks within a class that are used to break a complex problem into small manageble pieces.
- It is a collection of code statements that perform a specific task.
- Methods perform a specific task and can help eliminate redundacy and code.
- Other programming language have different names for these such as **functions, or modules**. But in java it is known as methods
- We have already created a method in every program that we've written so far that is **main method**
```java
public static void main(String[] args){

}
```

- We have also made calls to other methods such as the ones in the **Scanner class to input data**
