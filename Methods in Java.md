# Methods in Java
- Methods are a subtasks within a class that are used to break a complex problem into small manageble pieces.
- It is a collection of code statements that perform a specific task.
- Methods perform a specific task and can help eliminate redundacy and code.
- Other programming language have different names for these such as **functions, or modules**. But in java it is known as methods
- We have already created a method in every program that we've written so far that is **main method**
```java
public static void main(String[] args){

}
```

- We have also made calls to other methods such as the ones in the **Scanner class to input data** and the ones in the **System class to output the data**.
- Consider this program code below:

- let's examine the parts of the method:

- The very first line of the method is called the header

- The first word in a method is the access modifier.
- **Access modifiers** indicate who is allowed access to use this method.
- **Public** means any code from any class can use this method. 
- Having an access modifier is not required
