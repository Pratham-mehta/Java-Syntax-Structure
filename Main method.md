# Main Method in Java
Any code added between these 2 curly braces, will be known as Java Class<br>

- Inside the class we will create a method, which is another block of code.    **Method means Function (in other language)**
- In order to run any code from within a Java Class, **It must be inside of a method.**

## Implementation
```java
package gross_calculator;

public class GrossPayCalculator{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello Everyone");
    }
}
```

- To create the method, we will say **public static void main**
- after we will also add set of curly braces here 
- The method that we have added is called the main method, **which is the entry point for running the program** in java

### Execution:
- When we will execute this main method, the first thing is going to look for the main method within the class, and this is the starting point of the program.
- It has to always be defined like this **(Hence remember this)**

## Note:
- Methods(in Java) and fuctions will have curly braces _{...}_
- Later on we study more about functions or methods in detail.....Right now, remember that there is a main method as defined in the code segment above.

## Implementation: (Printing text in Java)
