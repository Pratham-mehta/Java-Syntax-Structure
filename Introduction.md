# Introduction
**Computers**:
- A computer is a machine capable of processing data.
- Computers are not smart or intelligent and therefore they need a program to provide precise intructions on how to do everything.

**Program**:
- A program is a software or a code, is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.
- Programs were originally written in Machine Language (A series of zeros and ones).

---

- Computers are only capable to understand only machine language (which is zeros and ones).
- Later people created much more friendly language such as Java.
- These programming languages are translated behind the scenes into machine language which is then interpreted by the computer's hardware.

In addition to java, there are other programming languages like:
1. Java
2. Python
3. JavaScript
4. C#
5. C
6. C++
7. Go
8. Ruby
9. Swift
10. PHP

**Algorithm**:
- An algorithm is a high level step by step guide to completing a task
- Given a problem using a algorithm you can solve that problem using an algorithm.
- An algorithm can be implemented using a programming language.

Let's consider a problem here ==>
**Problem**:
Write an algorithm to calculate an employee's gross pay

Solution:<br>
Step 1: Get the number of hours the employee worked<br>
Step 2: Get the hourly pay rate.<br>
Step 3: Multiply the hours by pay rate <br>
Step 4. Display the results. <br>

We can take this algorithm and implement using a programming language such as java
