# Introduction
**Computers**:
- A computer is a machine capable of processing data.
- Computers are not smart or intelligent and therefore they need a program to provide precise intructions on how to do everything.

**Program**:
- A program is a software or a code, is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.
- Programs were originally written in Machine Language (A series of zeros and ones).

- Computers are only capable to understand only machine language (which is zeros and ones).
- Later people created much more friendly language such as Java.
- These programming languages are translated behind the scenes into machine language which is then interpreted by the computer's hardware
